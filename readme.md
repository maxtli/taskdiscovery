# Task Discovery

To get started with task discovery, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.8. You can use the following command:

   ```shell
   conda create --name td python=3.8
   ```

2. Activate the conda environment:

   ```shell
   conda activate td
   ```

3. Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the `train_lens.ipynb` notebook to train your own modal lens to make sure everything is working. This notebook contains instructions and code for training the modal lens. For later, we have the pretrained weights under `results`.
